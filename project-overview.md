# Project Overview

Project Name: Retro Meme Pizza

Description: A nostalgic pizza ordering app with a meme-driven twist! Users invest "points" in trending reaction GIFs. If their chosen GIFs become "viral" (determined by a *mock* AI prediction), they unlock discounts and exclusive menu items.

Features:
*   **Pizza Ordering Interface:** A classic, retro-styled pizza ordering interface.
*   **Meme Investment:** Users can invest points in reaction GIFs from the current day.
*   **Mock AI Prediction:** A simulated AI algorithm determines which memes "go viral" based on user engagement (all mocked).
*   **Rewards System:** Successful meme investments unlock discounts/menu items.
*   **Nostalgic Design:** A design that evokes classic pizza parlors.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
